**Shell Variables:** `$PATH`, `$PWD`, `$HOME`, `$USER`, `$SHELL`, `$LANG`

* * *

* * *

Shell variables are predefined environment values provided by the Linux shell. They store important information about the user, system environment, and current session. Understanding these variables is essential for system administration, scripting, and daily command line usage.

This document explains the following shell variables in detail:

- PATH
    
- PWD
    
- HOME
    
- USER
    
- SHELL
    
- LANG
    

* * *

## 1\. What Are Shell Variables

Shell variables are key value pairs maintained by the shell. Some are local to the shell, while others are environment variables inherited by child processes. These variables influence how commands behave and how the system environment is configured.

You can view a variable using:

```bash
echo $VARIABLE_NAME
```

* * *

## 2\. PATH Variable

### Purpose

The PATH variable defines a list of directories that the shell searches when you run a command without specifying its full path.

### View PATH

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Example output:

```text
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

Each directory is separated by a colon. The shell searches them from left to right.

* * *

### How PATH Works

When you type:

```bash
ls
```

The shell looks for the ls executable in each directory listed in PATH until it finds a match.

* * *

### Modifying PATH Temporarily

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/myapp/bin
```

This change lasts only for the current session.

* * *

### Modifying PATH Permanently

Add the export command to one of the following files:

- ~/.bashrc
    
- ~/.profile
    
- ~/.zshrc
    

Example:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
```

* * *

### Best Practices for PATH

- Always append to PATH instead of overwriting it
    
- Avoid placing writable directories early in PATH
    
- Use absolute paths in scripts for reliability
    

* * *

## 3\. PWD Variable

### Purpose

PWD stores the full path of the current working directory.

### View PWD

```bash
echo $PWD
```

Example output:

```text
/home/user/projects
```

* * *

### How PWD Changes

PWD is updated automatically when you change directories using the cd command.

```bash
cd /etc
echo $PWD
```

* * *

### Difference Between PWD and pwd Command

- PWD is a shell variable
    
- pwd is a command that prints the current directory
    

Both usually return the same value, but PWD is faster because it is already stored in memory.

* * *

## 4\. HOME Variable

### Purpose

HOME defines the home directory of the current user. Many applications rely on this variable to locate user configuration files.

* * *

### View HOME

```bash
echo $HOME
```

Example output:

```text
/home/user
```

* * *

### Usage of HOME

Common use cases:

```bash
cd $HOME
cd ~
```

The tilde character expands to the HOME directory.

* * *

### HOME in Scripts

```bash
cp file.txt $HOME/backup/
```

* * *

## 5\. USER Variable

### Purpose

USER stores the name of the currently logged in user.

* * *

### View USER

```bash
echo $USER
```

Example output:

```text
user
```

* * *

### Usage of USER

```bash
echo "Current user is $USER"
```

This variable is useful for logging, scripting, and access checks.

* * *

## 6\. SHELL Variable

### Purpose

SHELL defines the default login shell for the current user.

* * *

### View SHELL

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

Example output:

```text
/bin/bash
```

* * *

### Difference Between SHELL and Current Shell

- SHELL shows the default login shell
    
- The currently running shell may be different
    

Check current shell process:

```bash
echo $0
```

* * *

### Changing Default Shell

Use the chsh command:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

* * *

## 7\. LANG Variable

### Purpose

LANG defines the system language, character encoding, and locale settings.

It affects:

- Language of system messages
    
- Date and time formats
    
- Number and currency formatting
    
- Character encoding
    

* * *

### View LANG

```bash
echo $LANG
```

Example output:

```text
en_US.UTF-8
```

* * *

### Locale Components

- Language code
    
- Country code
    
- Character encoding
    

* * *

### Changing LANG Temporarily

```bash
export LANG=C
```

This change applies only to the current session.

* * *

### Changing LANG Permanently

Add to shell configuration file:

```bash
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

* * *

## 8\. Environment Variables vs Local Variables

| Feature | Environment Variable | Local Variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Available to child processes | Yes | No  |
| Export required | Yes | No  |

PATH, HOME, USER, SHELL, and LANG are environment variables.

* * *

## 9\. Viewing All Environment Variables

```bash
printenv
```

or

```bash
env
```

* * *

## 10\. Best Practices

- Use predefined variables instead of hard coded paths
    
- Do not overwrite PATH accidentally
    
- Use HOME instead of absolute home paths
    
- Keep locale settings consistent across systems
    

* * *

## 11\. Summary

- PATH controls command lookup
    
- PWD stores the current directory
    
- HOME defines the user home directory
    
- USER identifies the logged in user
    
- SHELL defines the default shell
    
- LANG controls localization and encoding
