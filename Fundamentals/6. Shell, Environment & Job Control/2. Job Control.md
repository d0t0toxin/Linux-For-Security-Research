# Linux `jobs` Command

The **`jobs`** command is used in Linux **shell job control** to display the status of jobs that you started in the current shell session.

It is especially useful when working with **background processes**, **suspended tasks**, and **multiple commands running concurrently**.

* * *

## 1\. What is a Job in Linux?

A **job** is a command or pipeline of commands started from a shell.

Examples:

- Running a command in the background using `&`
    
- Suspending a command using `Ctrl + Z`
    
- Managing multiple running commands in one terminal
    

Each job is assigned:

- **Job ID** (e.g. `%1`, `%2`)
    
- **Process ID (PID)** (actual system process)
    

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
jobs [options] [job_id]
```

* * *

## 3\. Simple Example

```bash
sleep 100 &
```

Check jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

Output:

```text
[1]+  Running   sleep 100 &
```

Explanation:

- `[1]` → Job ID
    
- `+` → Current job
    
- `Running` → Job state
    
- `sleep 100 &` → Command
    

* * *

## 4\. Job States Explained

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Running | Job is actively executing |
| Stopped | Job is paused (Ctrl+Z) |
| Done | Job finished execution |
| Terminated | Job killed by signal |

* * *

## 5\. Foreground vs Background Jobs

### Background Job

```bash
command &
```

Example:

```bash
ping google.com &
```

### Foreground Job

Runs normally and blocks the terminal:

```bash
ping google.com
```

* * *

## 6\. Suspending a Job (Ctrl + Z)

```bash
sleep 300
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Output:

```text
[1]+  Stopped   sleep 300
```

Check:

```bash
jobs
```

* * *

## 7\. Resuming Jobs

### Resume in Background

```bash
bg %1
```

### Resume in Foreground

```bash
fg %1
```

* * *

## 8\. Job Identifiers

You can refer to jobs using:

| Identifier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `%1` | Job number 1 |
| `%+` | Current job |
| `%-` | Previous job |
| `%command` | Job starting with command |

Example:

```bash
fg %sleep
```

* * *

## 9\. `jobs` Command Options

### `jobs -l` (Show PIDs)

```bash
jobs -l
```

Output:

```text
[1]+  12345 Running sleep 100 &
```

* * *

### `jobs -p` (Only PIDs)

```bash
jobs -p
```

Output:

```text
12345
```

Useful for scripting.

* * *

### `jobs -n` (Changed Status Only)

```bash
jobs -n
```

Shows only jobs whose status changed since last check.

* * *

### `jobs -r` (Running Jobs Only)

```bash
jobs -r
```

* * *

### `jobs -s` (Stopped Jobs Only)

```bash
jobs -s
```

* * *

## 10\. Killing Jobs

### Kill by Job ID

```bash
kill %1
```

### Kill All Jobs

```bash
kill $(jobs -p)
```

* * *

## 11\. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Jobs

```bash
sleep 100 &
sleep 200 &
```

```bash
jobs
```

```text
[1]- Running sleep 100 &
[2]+ Running sleep 200 &
```

* * *

### Example 2: Suspend → Resume

```bash
nano file.txt
```

Press `Ctrl+Z`

```bash
bg
```

* * *

### Example 3: Bring Last Job to Foreground

```bash
fg
```

* * *

## 12\. `jobs` vs `ps`

| jobs | ps  |
| --- | --- |
| Shell built-in | System command |
| Shows only shell jobs | Shows all processes |
| Uses Job IDs | Uses PIDs |

* * *

## 13\. Important Notes

- `jobs` works **only in the same shell session**
    
- Jobs disappear after shell exits
    
- Not available in non-interactive shells
    

* * *

## 14\. Related Commands

```bash
bg    # Resume job in background
fg    # Resume job in foreground
kill  # Send signals to jobs
nohup # Run job immune to hangup
&     # Start background job
```

* * *

## 15\. Quick Summary

```bash
jobs        # List jobs
jobs -l     # Show PIDs
jobs -p     # Only PIDs
jobs -r     # Running jobs
jobs -s     # Stopped jobs
bg %1       # Resume job in background
fg %1       # Resume job in foreground
kill %1     # Kill job
```

* * *

* * *

# Linux `fg` Command

The **`fg`** command in Linux is used to **bring a background or stopped job to the foreground** of the current shell.

It is a core part of **job control** in Unix-like systems and works closely with `jobs`, `bg`, and `Ctrl + Z`.

* * *

## 1\. What Does `fg` Do?

- Resumes a **stopped job** in the foreground
    
- Brings a **background job** to the foreground
    
- Attaches the job to the terminal (stdin/stdout)
    

Once a job is in the foreground:

- It can receive keyboard input
    
- It blocks the terminal until it finishes or is stopped again
    

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
fg [job_id]
```

If `job_id` is omitted, `fg` uses the **current job** (`%+`).

* * *

## 3\. Understanding Job IDs

Job IDs are assigned by the shell and are **not PIDs**.

Common formats:

| Format | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `%1` | Job number 1 |
| `%+` | Current job |
| `%-` | Previous job |
| `%command` | Job starting with `command` |

* * *

## 4\. Simple Example

Start a command and suspend it:

```bash
sleep 300
```

Press:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Output:

```text
[1]+  Stopped   sleep 300
```

Bring it back to foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

* * *

## 5\. `fg` Without Arguments

```bash
fg
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
fg %+
```

It resumes the **current job**.

* * *

## 6\. Bringing Background Jobs to Foreground

```bash
ping google.com &
```

```bash
jobs
```

```text
[1]+ Running ping google.com &
```

Bring it to foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

Now you can stop it using `Ctrl + C`.

* * *

## 7\. Multiple Jobs Example

```bash
sleep 100 &
sleep 200 &
```

```bash
jobs
```

```text
[1]- Running sleep 100 &
[2]+ Running sleep 200 &
```

Bring job 1 to foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

* * *

## 8\. Using Command Name Instead of Job ID

```bash
sleep 500 &
nano file.txt
```

Suspend nano:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Bring nano to foreground:

```bash
fg %nano
```

* * *

## 9\. Foreground → Stop → Background → Foreground Cycle

```bash
nano notes.txt
```

1.  `Ctrl + Z` → stop job
    
2.  `bg` → resume in background
    
3.  `fg` → bring back to foreground
    

* * *

## 10\. Common Errors

### No Such Job

```bash
fg %3
```

```text
bash: fg: %3: no such job
```

Reason:

- Job already finished
    
- Wrong job number
    
- Different shell session
    

* * *

### No Current Job

```bash
fg
```

```text
bash: fg: no current job
```

* * *

## 11\. `fg` vs `bg`

| fg  | bg  |
| --- | --- |
| Runs job in foreground | Runs job in background |
| Takes terminal input | No terminal input |
| Blocks shell | Shell remains usable |

* * *

## 12\. `fg` vs `kill`

| fg  | kill |
| --- | --- |
| Resumes job | Terminates job |
| Keeps process alive | Stops process |

* * *

## 13\. Practical Use Cases

### Editing Files Safely

```bash
vim config.conf
```

Suspend with `Ctrl+Z`, run another command, then:

```bash
fg
```

* * *

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
top
```

Suspend, do something else, resume with `fg`.

* * *

## 14\. Important Notes

- `fg` is a **shell built-in** (bash, zsh)
    
- Works only in **interactive shells**
    
- Cannot bring jobs from another terminal
    
- Jobs disappear when shell exits
    

* * *

## 15\. Related Commands

```bash
jobs   # List jobs
bg     # Resume job in background
kill   # Terminate job
wait   # Wait for job completion
nohup  # Run job immune to hangup
```

* * *

## 16\. Quick Reference

```bash
fg        # Resume current job
fg %1     # Resume job 1
fg %cmd   # Resume job starting with cmd
Ctrl + Z  # Suspend foreground job
```

* * *

* * *

# Linux `bg` Command

The **`bg`** command in Linux is used to **resume a stopped job in the background**.

It is a core component of **job control** and complements `fg`, `jobs`, and `Ctrl + Z`.

* * *

## 1\. What Does `bg` Do?

- Resumes a **suspended/stopped job** in the background
    
- Allows the shell to remain usable
    
- Does **not attach the job to terminal input**
    

Once a job is in the background:

- It continues running
    
- You can monitor it using `jobs` or `ps`
    
- You can later bring it to the foreground using `fg`
    

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
bg [job_id]
```

If `job_id` is omitted, `bg` uses the **current job** (`%+`).

* * *

## 3\. Understanding Job IDs

Job IDs are shell-assigned, not PIDs.

| Format | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `%1` | Job number 1 |
| `%+` | Current job |
| `%-` | Previous job |
| `%command` | Job starting with `command` |

* * *

## 4\. Simple Example

Start a command and suspend it:

```bash
sleep 300
```

Press `Ctrl + Z` to suspend:

```text
[1]+  Stopped   sleep 300
```

Resume in the background:

```bash
bg %1
```

Check jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

```text
[1]+  Running   sleep 300 &
```

* * *

## 5\. `bg` Without Arguments

```bash
bg
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
bg %+
```

It resumes the **current stopped job** in the background.

* * *

## 6\. Bringing Multiple Jobs to Background

```bash
sleep 100 &
sleep 200
```

Suspend second job:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Check jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

```text
[1]- Running sleep 100 &
[2]+ Stopped sleep 200
```

Resume job 2 in background:

```bash
bg %2
```

* * *

## 7\. Using Command Name Instead of Job ID

```bash
nano file.txt
```

Suspend with `Ctrl + Z`:

```bash
[1]+  Stopped   nano file.txt
```

Resume in background using command name:

```bash
bg %nano
```

* * *

## 8\. `bg` vs `fg`

| bg  | fg  |
| --- | --- |
| Resumes job in background | Resumes job in foreground |
| Shell remains usable | Blocks terminal until job finishes |
| Job cannot take input | Job can take terminal input |

* * *

## 9\. `bg` vs `kill`

| bg  | kill |
| --- | --- |
| Resume job | Terminate job |
| Keeps process alive | Stops process |

* * *

## 10\. Practical Use Cases

### Running Long Tasks Without Blocking Terminal

```bash
rsync -av source/ dest/
```

Suspend with `Ctrl + Z` and then:

```bash
bg
```

This allows you to continue using the shell while rsync runs.

### Multi-Tasking

```bash
sleep 100 &
sleep 200
```

Suspend second job, resume in background:

```bash
bg %2
```

* * *

## 11\. Monitoring Background Jobs

```bash
jobs
ps -ef | grep sleep
```

* * *

## 12\. Common Errors

### No Such Job

```bash
bg %3
```

```text
bash: bg: %3: no such job
```

Reason:

- Job already finished
    
- Wrong job number
    
- Different shell session
    

### No Current Job

```bash
bg
```

```text
bash: bg: no current job
```

* * *

## 13\. Important Notes

- `bg` is a **shell built-in**
    
- Works **only in interactive shells**
    
- Cannot resume jobs from another terminal
    
- Jobs disappear when shell exits
    

* * *

## 14\. Related Commands

```bash
jobs   # List jobs
fg     # Bring job to foreground
kill   # Terminate job
wait   # Wait for job completion
nohup  # Run job immune to hangup
```

* * *

## 15\. Quick Reference

```bash
Ctrl + Z  # Suspend foreground job
bg         # Resume current stopped job in background
bg %1      # Resume job 1 in background
fg %1      # Bring job 1 to foreground
jobs       # Check job status
```

* * *

* * *

# Linux `disown` Command

The **`disown`** command in Linux is used to **remove jobs from the shell's job table**. This allows the jobs to **continue running even after the shell exits**.

It is especially useful for **long-running tasks** or when using SSH sessions that may close.

* * *

## 1\. What Does `disown` Do?

- Removes a job from the **shell's job table**
    
- Prevents **SIGHUP (hangup signal)** from being sent to the job when the shell exits
    
- Can be used with jobs started **in the background** or **stopped**
    

Once disowned:

- Job keeps running independently of the shell
    
- It will not appear in `jobs` anymore
    
- Cannot be brought to the foreground with `fg`
    

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
disown [options] [job_id]
```

If `job_id` is omitted, the **current job** is disowned.

* * *

## 3\. Understanding Job IDs

| Format | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `%1` | Job number 1 |
| `%+` | Current job |
| `%-` | Previous job |
| `%command` | Job starting with `command` |

* * *

## 4\. Simple Example

Start a background job:

```bash
sleep 300 &
```

Check jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

```text
[1]+  Running   sleep 300 &
```

Disown the job:

```bash
disown %1
```

Check jobs again:

```bash
jobs
```

Output:

```text
(no output)
```

The job continues running in the background even if you close the shell.

* * *

## 5\. Using `disown` Without Arguments

```bash
disown
```

Removes the **current job** (`%+`) from the job table.

* * *

## 6\. Options

### `-h` (Prevent SIGHUP, but keep in jobs table)

```bash
disown -h %1
```

- Job stays in `jobs` output
    
- Job will not receive SIGHUP when shell exits
    

### `-a` (All jobs)

```bash
disown -a
```

- Disowns **all jobs**

### `-r` (Running jobs only)

```bash
disown -r
```

- Disowns only **running jobs**

* * *

## 7\. Practical Use Cases

### Example 1: Long-Running Background Task

```bash
rsync -av source/ dest/ &
```

Disown it so it continues after logout:

```bash
disown %1
```

Logout safely. Task continues running.

### Example 2: Stop & Disown

```bash
nano bigfile.txt
```

Suspend job:

```text
Ctrl + Z
```

Resume in background:

```bash
bg %nano
```

Disown:

```bash
disown %nano
```

Now it runs independently.

* * *

## 8\. Monitoring Disowned Jobs

Use `ps` to see disowned jobs:

```bash
ps -ef | grep sleep
```

`jobs` will not show disowned jobs.

* * *

## 9\. `disown` vs `nohup`

| disown | nohup |
| --- | --- |
| Removes job from shell table | Starts job immune to hangup from the start |
| Job already started | Job started with nohup cannot be interrupted by SIGHUP |
| Works interactively | Can be used in scripts |

You can combine `nohup` and `disown` for robust long-running tasks:

```bash
nohup rsync -av source/ dest/ &
disown
```

* * *

## 10\. Common Errors

### No Such Job

```bash
disown %3
```

```text
bash: disown: %3: no such job
```

### No Current Job

```bash
disown
```

```text
bash: disown: no current job
```

* * *

## 11\. Important Notes

- `disown` is a **bash/zsh built-in**
    
- Works **only in interactive shells**
    
- Disowned jobs **cannot be resumed** with `fg`
    
- Useful in SSH sessions or scripts that run background tasks
    

* * *

## 12\. Related Commands

```bash
jobs    # List jobs
fg      # Bring job to foreground
bg      # Resume job in background
kill    # Terminate job
nohup   # Run job immune to hangup
```

* * *

## 13\. Quick Reference

```bash
sleep 300 &       # Start background job
disown %1         # Disown job 1
disown            # Disown current job
disown -h %1      # Prevent SIGHUP but keep in jobs table
disown -a         # Disown all jobs
ps -ef | grep sleep  # Monitor disowned job
```

* * *

* * *

# Linux `kill` Command

The **`kill`** command in Linux is used to **send signals to processes**. Most commonly, it is used to **terminate processes**, but it can send other signals as well.

It works with **process IDs (PIDs)** and can be used for both foreground and background processes.

* * *

## 1\. What Does `kill` Do?

- Sends a **signal** to a process
    
- Commonly used signals:
    
    - `SIGTERM` (15) → Graceful termination
        
    - `SIGKILL` (9) → Forceful termination
        
    - `SIGHUP` (1) → Hangup
        
    - `SIGSTOP` → Stop process
        
    - `SIGCONT` → Continue a stopped process
        

Once a process receives a termination signal, it may clean up resources before exiting (except `SIGKILL`).

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
kill [options] <PID>
```

- `<PID>` is the **Process ID** of the process you want to signal
    
- Multiple PIDs can be provided separated by spaces
    

* * *

## 3\. Finding PIDs

You can find process IDs using:

```bash
ps aux | grep process_name
pgrep process_name
jobs -l        # For background jobs in the current shell
```

Example:

```bash
ps aux | grep sleep
```

```text
user  12345  0.0  0.0  123456  1234 pts/0  S  12:00  0:00 sleep 300
```

Here, PID = `12345`.

* * *

## 4\. Simple Example: Kill a Process

```bash
kill 12345
```

- Sends `SIGTERM` (default) to PID 12345
    
- Process may terminate gracefully
    

Check if it is terminated:

```bash
ps -p 12345
```

* * *

## 5\. Force Kill a Process

If the process ignores `SIGTERM`:

```bash
kill -9 12345
```

- Sends `SIGKILL` (cannot be ignored)
    
- Process is terminated immediately
    

* * *

## 6\. Kill Multiple Processes

```bash
kill 12345 12346 12347
```

Or using `pgrep`:

```bash
kill $(pgrep process_name)
```

* * *

## 7\. Using Signal Names

```bash
kill -SIGTERM 12345
kill -SIGKILL 12345
kill -SIGHUP 12345
```

Signal numbers can also be used:

```bash
kill -15 12345   # SIGTERM
kill -9 12345    # SIGKILL
```

* * *

## 8\. Kill Background Jobs Using Job ID

```bash
sleep 300 &
jobs -l
kill %1
```

- `%1` is the **job ID** from `jobs -l`
    
- Sends `SIGTERM` to the background job
    

* * *

## 9\. Stopping and Continuing Jobs

```bash
kill -STOP 12345   # Stop process (pause)
kill -CONT 12345   # Resume process
```

- Useful with `fg`/`bg`
    
- Combine with job control
    

* * *

## 10\. Using `killall` (Kill by Process Name)

```bash
killall process_name
killall -9 process_name
```

- Kills all processes with that **name**
    
- Works like `kill` but does not require PID
    

* * *

## 11\. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Stop a Running Job

```bash
sleep 500 &
jobs
kill %1
```

### Example 2: Terminate a Process by PID

```bash
ps aux | grep firefox
kill 54321
```

### Example 3: Force Terminate Stubborn Process

```bash
kill -9 54321
```

### Example 4: Stop and Resume Job

```bash
top
Ctrl + Z
jobs
kill -STOP %1
kill -CONT %1
fg %1
```

* * *

## 12\. Common Errors

### No Such Process

```bash
kill 99999
```

```text
bash: kill: (99999) - No such process
```

### Permission Denied

```bash
kill 1
```

- Only root can kill some system processes

* * *

## 13\. Important Notes

- `kill` **does not always kill the process gracefully**
    
- `SIGKILL` should be used when a process ignores `SIGTERM`
    
- Use `jobs -l` or `ps` to confirm PID before killing
    
- `kill` can be combined with job control commands (`fg`, `bg`, `disown`)
    

* * *

## 14\. Related Commands

```bash
jobs    # List background jobs
fg      # Bring job to foreground
bg      # Resume job in background
disown  # Remove job from shell table
ps      # List processes
pgrep   # Find PID by process name
killall # Kill processes by name
```

* * *

## 15\. Quick Reference

```bash
kill PID             # Send SIGTERM
kill -9 PID          # Force kill (SIGKILL)
kill -STOP PID        # Stop process
kill -CONT PID        # Continue stopped process
kill %1               # Kill job by job ID
killall process_name  # Kill all processes with that name
```

* * *

* * *

# Linux `wait` Command

The **`wait`** command in Linux is used to **wait for background jobs or processes to finish** before continuing execution in a shell script or interactive shell.

It is commonly used in **scripting** to synchronize processes.

* * *

## 1\. What Does `wait` Do?

- Waits for **one or more background processes** to complete
    
- Returns the **exit status** of the waited process
    
- Allows **sequencing of commands** in scripts
    

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
wait [options] [PID or job_id]
```

- If no PID or job ID is given, `wait` waits for **all background jobs** to finish.

* * *

## 3\. Using `wait` with Background Jobs

Start a background job:

```bash
sleep 10 &
```

Check jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

Wait for the job to finish:

```bash
wait %1
```

- `%1` is the job ID from `jobs`
    
- Shell will pause until `sleep 10` completes
    

* * *

## 4\. Using `wait` with PIDs

```bash
sleep 5 &
pid=$!
echo "Waiting for process $pid"
wait $pid
echo "Process $pid finished"
```

- `$!` stores the **PID of the last background process**
    
- Waits for that specific process
    

* * *

## 5\. Using `wait` in Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sleep 3 &
sleep 5 &

echo "Waiting for all background jobs to finish..."
wait

echo "All background jobs finished."
```

* * *

* * *

# Linux `nohup` Command

The **`nohup`** command in Linux is used to **run a command immune to hangup signals (SIGHUP)**, allowing the command to **continue running after the user logs out or closes the terminal**.

It is commonly used for **long-running processes** in servers or remote sessions.

* * *

## 1\. What Does `nohup` Do?

- Prevents the process from being terminated when the **terminal closes**
    
- Redirects **output to `nohup.out`** by default if not specified
    
- Useful for **background processes**
    

* * *

## 2\. Basic Syntax

```bash
nohup command [arguments] [&]
```

- Adding `&` runs the process in **background**
    
- Output is saved to `nohup.out` unless redirected
    

* * *

## 3\. Simple Example

```bash
nohup sleep 300 &
```

Output:

```text
[1] 12345
```

- `12345` is the **PID** of the background process
    
- Check process:
    

```bash
ps -ef | grep sleep
```

* * *

## 4\. Redirecting Output

By default, output goes to `nohup.out`:

```bash
nohup command > output.log 2>&1 &
```

- `> output.log` redirects **stdout**
    
- `2>&1` redirects **stderr**
    
- `&` runs in **background**
    

* * *

## 5\. Running Scripts with nohup

```bash
nohup ./long_script.sh > script.log 2>&1 &
```

- Script continues running even if terminal is closed
    
- Logs all output to `script.log`
    

* * *

## 6\. Combining `nohup` with `disown`

```bash
nohup long_command &
disown %1
```

- Ensures process keeps running **after logout**
    
- Removes job from shell table
    

* * *

## 7\. Checking nohup Processes

```bash
ps -ef | grep command_name
```

- `jobs` will **not show** the process if disowned
    
- Useful for monitoring remote processes
    

* * *

## 8\. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Run Long Task After SSH Logout

```bash
nohup rsync -av /source /dest > rsync.log 2>&1 &
```

- Task continues even if SSH session is closed
    
- Output saved in `rsync.log`
    

### Example 2: Running a Server

```bash
nohup python3 -m http.server 8080 > server.log 2>&1 &
```

- Server continues running in background
    
- Logs saved to `server.log`
    

### Example 3: Using `disown` for Extra Safety

```bash
nohup backup.sh &
disown %1
```

* * *

## 9\. Important Notes

- `nohup` is useful for **remote servers and long-running processes**
    
- Always redirect output to avoid creating large `nohup.out` files
    
- Combine with `&` and `disown` for fully independent background tasks

```bash
jobs     # List jobs in current shell
fg       # Bring job to foreground
bg       # Resume job in background
disown   # Remove job from shell table
kill     # Terminate process
wait     # Wait for process to finish
```

## 11\. Quick Reference

```bash
nohup command &                 # Run command immune to hangup
nohup command > output.log &     # Redirect output to file
nohup script.sh &               # Run script in background
nohup script.sh > log 2>&1 &    # Redirect stdout and stderr
nohup command & disown %1        # Ensure command keeps running after logout
```
