# `systemctl list-timers` command in Linux

This document explains the systemctl list-timers command in detail. It covers what the command does, how it works, available options, output fields, practical examples, and common use cases. The content is written so you can copy it directly and use it as a reference.

## What is systemctl

systemctl is the main command line tool used to control and inspect the systemd system and service manager. It is used to manage services, sockets, devices, mounts, and timers.

A timer in systemd is similar to a cron job. Timers trigger services or other units at specific times or after certain events.

## What is systemctl list-timers

systemctl list-timers is used to display all systemd timers that are currently loaded in memory. It shows when timers last ran, when they will run next, and which unit they activate.

This command is commonly used to

Understand scheduled tasks handled by systemd  
Debug timers that are not running as expected  
Replace or audit traditional cron jobs

## Basic syntax

```
systemctl list-timers
```

This shows all active timers for the entire system.

## Example basic output

```
NEXT                         LEFT          LAST                         PASSED       UNIT                         ACTIVATES
Sat 2026-01-24 18:00:00 NPT  3h 20min      Sat 2026-01-24 06:00:01 NPT  8h ago       logrotate.timer             logrotate.service
Sun 2026-01-25 00:00:00 NPT  9h 20min      Fri 2026-01-23 00:00:02 NPT  1 day ago    man-db.timer                man-db.service
```

## Explanation of output columns

NEXT  
The next time the timer is scheduled to run

LEFT  
The amount of time remaining until the next run

LAST  
The last time the timer was triggered

PASSED  
How much time has passed since the last run

UNIT  
The name of the timer unit

ACTIVATES  
The service unit that is started when the timer fires

## Listing timers including inactive ones

By default only active timers are shown. To see all timers including inactive ones

```
systemctl list-timers --all
```

This is useful when a timer exists but is disabled or not loaded.

## Listing user timers

Systemd also supports user level timers. These run under a specific user account.

To list timers for the current user

```
systemctl --user list-timers
```

User timers are commonly used for desktop or per user background tasks.

## Listing timers for a specific user

If you are logged in as root, you can inspect timers for another user

```
sudo systemctl --user --machine=username@ list-timers
```

## Sorting timers

Timers are sorted by next run time by default. You can change sorting using the systemctl options

```
systemctl list-timers --no-pager
```

This disables paging and is useful for scripting or logging.

## Using list-timers in scripts

You can combine list-timers with other tools for automation

```
systemctl list-timers --all | grep backup
```

This filters timers related to backups.

## Understanding how timers work with services

A timer unit usually has the same name as the service it triggers

Example

backup.timer triggers backup.service

The timer defines when the action happens  
The service defines what action happens

## Viewing a specific timer configuration

To inspect the full configuration of a timer

```
systemctl cat backup.timer
```

This shows the timer unit file including scheduling rules.

## Checking timer status

To see detailed status information for a timer

```
systemctl status backup.timer
```

This includes logs, last run status, and whether the timer is enabled.

## Enabling and disabling timers

Enable a timer so it runs automatically

```
sudo systemctl enable backup.timer
```

Disable a timer

```
sudo systemctl disable backup.timer
```

Start or stop a timer immediately

```
sudo systemctl start backup.timer
sudo systemctl stop backup.timer
```

## Relationship between timers and cron

systemd timers can replace cron jobs

Advantages

Timers can run even if the system was powered off  
Timers integrate with systemd logging  
Timers support complex scheduling rules

## Common system timers

Some timers commonly found on Linux systems

logrotate.timer  
man-db.timer  
apt-daily.timer  
fstrim.timer

These are usually visible using systemctl list-timers.

## Troubleshooting timers using list-timers

If a timer is not running

Check if it appears in list-timers  
Check if it is enabled  
Check the associated service logs

```
journalctl -u backup.service
```

## Summary

systemctl list-timers is a powerful inspection command for systemd based scheduling. It allows you to see when tasks run, what they trigger, and helps replace and debug cron based workflows. It is essential for understanding time based automation on modern Linux systems.

# `systemctl enable --now <timer>` command in Linux

This document explains the systemctl enable --now timer command in detail. It covers what the command does, why it is used, how it works internally, and many practical examples. The content is written so you can copy it directly as a markdown reference.

## What is systemctl enable --now

systemctl enable --now is a combined command used with systemd. It performs two actions at the same time

It enables a unit so it starts automatically on boot  
It starts the unit immediately without waiting for a reboot

When used with a timer unit, this command ensures that the timer becomes persistent and active right away.

## Meaning of each part of the command

systemctl  
The systemd control command used to manage units

enable  
Configures the unit to start automatically at boot by creating symbolic links

\--now  
Tells systemctl to start the unit immediately after enabling it

## Basic syntax

```
systemctl enable --now example.timer
```

This enables the timer and starts it instantly.

## What happens internally

When you run systemctl enable --now with a timer

systemd creates the required boot time links for the timer  
systemd loads the timer unit into memory  
systemd starts counting time according to the timer configuration

The associated service is not started immediately unless the timer is configured to trigger right away.

## Difference between enable and start

enable only  
The timer will run after the next reboot

start only  
The timer runs now but will not survive a reboot

enable --now  
The timer runs now and also after every reboot

This makes enable --now the most common and recommended option for timers.

## Example one enabling a backup timer

Assume you have two unit files

backup.timer  
backup.service

To enable and start the timer

```
sudo systemctl enable --now backup.timer
```

Result

The timer becomes active immediately  
The timer will remain active after reboot  
backup.service will run when the timer triggers

## Verifying the timer is active

After enabling the timer you can verify it

```
systemctl list-timers
```

You should see backup.timer listed with its next scheduled run time.

## Checking timer status

To see detailed information

```
systemctl status backup.timer
```

This shows

Whether the timer is loaded  
Whether it is active  
The last and next trigger time

## Example two enabling a system maintenance timer

Enable a built in system timer

```
sudo systemctl enable --now fstrim.timer
```

This schedules automatic filesystem trimming and activates it immediately.

## Using enable --now with user timers

Systemd also supports user level timers

Enable and start a user timer

```
systemctl --user enable --now cleanup.timer
```

This runs the timer under the current user account and activates it without root privileges.

## When to use sudo

System timers  
Require sudo or root access

User timers  
Do not require sudo

Using sudo on user timers can cause confusion and should be avoided.

## Common mistakes

Using enable without --now and expecting immediate execution  
Enabling the service instead of the timer  
Misspelling the timer unit name

Correct usage always targets the .timer unit not the .service unit.

## Relationship between timer and service

A timer does not perform work by itself

The timer only schedules execution  
The service performs the actual task

Example

logrotate.timer schedules execution  
logrotate.service performs log rotation

## Disabling a timer enabled with --now

To stop and disable the timer

```
sudo systemctl disable --now backup.timer
```

This stops the timer immediately and removes it from boot startup.

## Checking boot persistence

To verify a timer is enabled at boot

```
systemctl is-enabled backup.timer
```

Expected output

enabled

## Why enable --now is recommended for timers

It avoids forgetting to start the timer  
It guarantees persistence across reboots  
It reduces administrative errors

For most real world usage this is the safest and simplest way to activate timers.

## Summary

systemctl enable --now timer is the standard command to activate systemd timers correctly. It ensures the timer starts immediately and continues running after reboot. Understanding this command is essential for managing scheduled tasks on modern Linux systems.

# `systemctl start <timer>` command in Linux

This document explains the systemctl start timer command in detail. It describes what the command does, how it behaves with systemd timers, when to use it, and provides practical examples. The content is written so you can copy it directly as a markdown reference.

## What is systemctl start

systemctl start is used to start a systemd unit immediately. It loads the unit into memory and activates it for the current boot session.

When used with a timer unit, it starts the timer right away but does not make it persistent across reboots.

## Meaning of each part of the command

systemctl  
The systemd control command used to manage units

start  
Instructs systemd to activate the unit immediately

## Basic syntax

```
systemctl start example.timer
```

This starts the timer instantly for the current session.

## What happens internally

When you run systemctl start with a timer

systemd loads the timer unit into memory  
systemd begins tracking time based on the timer configuration  
systemd waits until the scheduled trigger condition is met

The associated service is executed only when the timer fires not when the timer is started.

## Important behavior of systemctl start with timers

Starting a timer does not enable it

This means

The timer will stop working after a reboot  
The timer will not start automatically on system startup

For permanent timers systemctl enable is required.

## Example one starting a backup timer temporarily

Assume you have

backup.timer  
backup.service

To start the timer for the current session

```
sudo systemctl start backup.timer
```

Result

The timer becomes active immediately  
The timer will stop after reboot  
backup.service runs only when the timer triggers

## Verifying the timer is running

Check active timers

```
systemctl list-timers
```

If backup.timer appears in the list then it is running.

## Checking timer status

View detailed information

```
systemctl status backup.timer
```

This shows

Whether the timer is loaded  
Whether it is currently active  
The next scheduled trigger time

## Example two starting a system timer for testing

You may want to test a built in timer without enabling it

```
sudo systemctl start logrotate.timer
```

This allows you to observe its behavior without making permanent changes.

## Using systemctl start with user timers

User timers run under a specific user account

Start a user timer

```
systemctl --user start cleanup.timer
```

This activates the timer only for the current login session unless lingering is enabled.

## systemctl start vs systemctl enable

systemctl start  
Starts the timer now  
Does not persist across reboot

systemctl enable  
Persists across reboot  
Does not start immediately

systemctl enable --now  
Starts immediately  
Persists across reboot

Understanding this difference is critical when managing timers.

## Common mistakes

Expecting systemctl start to survive reboot  
Starting the service instead of the timer  
Assuming the service runs immediately

Correct usage always targets the .timer unit.

## Stopping a timer started with systemctl start

To stop the timer

```
sudo systemctl stop backup.timer
```

This halts the timer for the current session.

## Checking whether a timer is enabled

To see if a timer is enabled at boot

```
systemctl is-enabled backup.timer
```

Expected output when started but not enabled

disabled

## When to use systemctl start with timers

Temporary testing  
Debugging timer behavior  
One time scheduled activity

For production or long term scheduling enable --now is preferred.

## Summary

systemctl start timer is used to activate a systemd timer immediately for the current session only. It is ideal for testing and temporary scheduling but does not provide persistence across reboots. For permanent timers systemctl enable or enable --now should be used.

# `systemctl stop <timer>` command in Linux

This document explains the systemctl stop timer command in detail. It covers what the command does how it behaves with systemd timers when to use it and practical examples. The content is written so you can copy it directly as a markdown reference.

## What is systemctl stop

systemctl stop is used to stop a running systemd unit immediately. When applied to a timer unit it stops the timer from triggering any future scheduled actions for the current session.

Stopping a timer does not remove it from the system and does not change whether it starts at boot.

## Meaning of each part of the command

systemctl  
The systemd control command used to manage units

stop  
Instructs systemd to halt the unit immediately

## Basic syntax

```
systemctl stop example.timer
```

This stops the timer immediately.

## What happens internally

When you run systemctl stop with a timer

systemd cancels the timer schedule  
systemd unloads the active timer state from memory  
systemd prevents future triggers while stopped

The associated service is not affected if it is currently running.

## Important behavior of systemctl stop with timers

Stopping a timer does not disable it

This means

If the timer is enabled it will start again after reboot  
If the timer is started manually it can be started again without enabling

To permanently prevent execution the timer must be disabled.

## Example one stopping a backup timer

Assume you have

backup.timer  
backup.service

To stop the timer

```
sudo systemctl stop backup.timer
```

Result

The timer stops immediately  
No future triggers occur during this session  
backup.service will not be started by the timer

## Verifying the timer is stopped

Check active timers

```
systemctl list-timers
```

If backup.timer does not appear then it is stopped.

## Checking timer status

View detailed status

```
systemctl status backup.timer
```

This shows

The timer is inactive  
Whether it is enabled or disabled  
The last time it was triggered

## Example two stopping a system timer temporarily

You may want to pause a built in timer for troubleshooting

```
sudo systemctl stop logrotate.timer
```

This pauses log rotation until the timer is started again or the system reboots.

## Using systemctl stop with user timers

User timers run under a user account

Stop a user timer

```
systemctl --user stop cleanup.timer
```

This stops the timer for the current user session.

## systemctl stop vs systemctl disable

systemctl stop  
Stops the timer now  
Does not affect boot behavior

systemctl disable  
Prevents the timer from starting at boot  
Does not stop a running timer

systemctl disable --now  
Stops the timer now  
Prevents the timer from starting at boot

Understanding this difference is essential for proper timer management.

## Common mistakes

Expecting systemctl stop to survive reboot  
Stopping the service instead of the timer  
Assuming the timer is disabled after stopping

Always target the timer unit when managing schedules.

## Restarting a stopped timer

To restart the timer

```
sudo systemctl start backup.timer
```

If persistence is required use enable now instead.

## Checking whether a timer is enabled

To verify boot behavior

```
systemctl is-enabled backup.timer
```

Possible outputs include enabled disabled or static.

## When to use systemctl stop with timers

Temporary suspension of scheduled tasks  
Debugging timer behavior  
Maintenance windows

For permanent changes disabling the timer is recommended.

## Summary

systemctl stop timer is used to halt a running systemd timer immediately. It affects only the current session and does not change boot persistence. It is ideal for temporary control and troubleshooting of scheduled tasks.
