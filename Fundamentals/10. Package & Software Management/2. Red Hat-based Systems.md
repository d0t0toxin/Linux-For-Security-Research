# `dnf` Command in Linux

## Introduction

DNF stands for Dandified Yum. It is the modern package manager used by RPM based Linux distributions such as Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, and CentOS Stream. DNF is the successor to YUM and provides better performance, dependency resolution, and a cleaner command interface.

DNF is used to install, update, remove, search, and manage software packages from configured repositories.

## Basic Syntax

# MicroDNF Command in Linux

## Introduction

MicroDNF is a lightweight version of the DNF package manager. It is designed for minimal container environments such as Docker and Podman, where reducing image size is critical. MicroDNF provides basic package management capabilities such as installing, updating, removing, and querying packages but with fewer features compared to full DNF.

MicroDNF is commonly used in Red Hat Universal Base Images and Fedora minimal images.

```
microdnf --version
```

Displays MicroDNF version and system information.

## Installing Packages

Install a single package:

```
sudo microdnf install nginx
```

Install multiple packages:

```
sudo microdnf install git curl wget
```

MicroDNF automatically resolves dependencies from available repositories.

## Removing Packages

```
sudo microdnf remove nginx
```

Removes the specified package.

## Updating Packages

Update all installed packages:

```
sudo microdnf update
```

Update a specific package:

```
sudo microdnf update nginx
```

## Listing Installed Packages

```
microdnf list installed
```

Displays all installed packages.

## Listing Available Packages

```
microdnf list available
```

Displays packages available in enabled repositories.

## Searching for Packages

```
microdnf search nginx
```

Searches for packages matching the specified keyword.

## Getting Package Information

```
microdnf info nginx
```

Displays details about the package such as version, repository, and description.

## Cleaning Cache

```
sudo microdnf clean all
```

Removes cached metadata and package files.

## Installing from Local RPM

```
sudo microdnf install ./package-name.rpm
```

Installs a local RPM package and resolves dependencies from repositories.

## Non Interactive Mode

```

```

Automatically confirms all prompts without user interaction.

## Updating Repositories

```
sudo microdnf repolist
```

Lists available repositories.

```
sudo microdnf update -y
```

Updates packages from all enabled repositories.

## Downloading Packages Without Installing

```
microdnf download nginx
```

## Differences Between MicroDNF and DNF

MicroDNF is minimal and lightweight  
MicroDNF is designed for containers  
MicroDNF has fewer features and plugins compared to DNF  
DNF provides full system management, MicroDNF is suitable for minimal environments

## Best Practices

Use MicroDNF in containerized environments  
Keep containers updated with security patches  
Remove unnecessary packages to keep images small  
Use official repositories to ensure stability and security

## Conclusion

MicroDNF is a simplified, efficient package manager for minimal Linux environments, particularly in containers. It provides essential package management functionalities with a small footprint, making it ideal for containerized applications and lightweight images.

# RPM Command in Linux

## Introduction

RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager. It is a low-level package management tool used in RPM based Linux distributions such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, Rocky Linux, and AlmaLinux. RPM is used to install, update, remove, verify, and query individual RPM packages.

Unlike YUM or DNF, RPM does not automatically resolve dependencies. It operates on individual package files.

## Basic Syntax

```
rpm [options] package-file
```

or for queries:

```
rpm [query options] [package-name]
```

## Checking RPM Version

```
rpm --version
```

Displays the installed RPM version.

## Installing Packages

Install an RPM package:

```
sudo rpm -i package-name.rpm
```

Force install (overwrite existing files):

```
sudo rpm -i --force package-name.rpm
```

Upgrade an existing package:

```
sudo rpm -U package-name.rpm
```

Freshen (upgrade only if package exists):

```
sudo rpm -F package-name.rpm
```

## Removing Packages

```
sudo rpm -e package-name
```

Removes the package from the system.

Force removal ignoring dependencies:

```
sudo rpm -e --nodeps package-name
```

## Querying Packages

List all installed packages:

```
rpm -qa
```

Get detailed information about a specific package:

```
rpm -qi package-name
```

List files installed by a package:

```
rpm -ql package-name
```

Check which package owns a file:

```
rpm -qf /path/to/file
```

List documentation files of a package:

```
rpm -qd package-name
```

List scripts executed during package installation or removal:

```
rpm -q --scripts package-name
```

Query packages by a specific pattern:

```
rpm -qa 'httpd*'
```

## Verifying Packages

Verify installed packages for integrity:

```
rpm -V package-name
```

This checks for file size, permissions, MD5 checksum, and other attributes.

Verify all packages:

```
rpm -Va
```

## Importing and Managing GPG Keys

Import a GPG key for verifying package signatures:

```
sudo rpm --import /path/to/RPM-GPG-KEY
```

List all imported keys:

```
rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*
```

Verify a package signature:

```
rpm --checksig package-name.rpm
```

## Building RPM Packages

Initialize build environment:

```
rpmdev-setuptree
```

Build an RPM from a spec file:

```
rpmbuild -ba package.spec
```

## Querying Package Database

List all packages with a summary:

```
rpm -qa --qf '%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{ARCH}
'
```

## Checking Dependencies

Check dependencies of an RPM file:

```
rpm -qpR package-name.rpm
```

Check which packages require a specific package:

```
rpm -q --whatrequires package-name
```

Check what capabilities a package provides:

```
rpm -q --provides package-name
```

Check what capabilities a package requires:

```
rpm -q --requires package-name
```

## Verifying Database and Repair

Rebuild RPM database:

```
sudo rpm --rebuilddb
```

## Troubleshooting

Verbose installation:

```
sudo rpm -ivh package-name.rpm
```

This shows hash marks indicating progress.

Force dependencies ignored:

```
sudo rpm -i --nodeps package-name.rpm
```

## Configuration Files

RPM configuration file location:

```
/etc/rpm/macros
/etc/rpmrc
```

RPM database location:

```
/var/lib/rpm/
```

## Best Practices

Always verify packages with GPG keys  
Prefer using DNF or YUM for dependency resolution  
Keep RPM database healthy and rebuild if corrupted  
Check package integrity using rpm -V

## Conclusion

RPM is a powerful low-level package management tool for handling individual RPM files. Mastering RPM commands is essential for troubleshooting, managing packages without repository tools, and building custom RPM packages.
