# Linux `uptime` Command

The `uptime` command in Linux is used to display how long the system has been running, the number of users currently logged in, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

## Syntax

```bash
uptime [options]
```

## Description

`uptime` provides a quick overview of system uptime and load. It is often used by system administrators to monitor system performance and activity.

## Output Format

A typical output of `uptime` looks like:

```
 18:23:01 up 10 days,  3:15,  2 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.10, 0.05
```

Explanation:

- `18:23:01` → Current system time.
    
- `up 10 days, 3:15` → System uptime (10 days and 3 hours 15 minutes).
    
- `2 users` → Number of users currently logged in.
    
- `load average: 0.15, 0.10, 0.05` → Average system load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
    

## Common Options

- `-p` : Show uptime in a pretty format.
    
- `-s` : Show the system startup time.
    
- `-h` : Display help information.
    

## Examples

### 1\. Basic usage

```bash
$ uptime
 18:23:01 up 10 days,  3:15,  2 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.10, 0.05
```

### 2\. Pretty format

```bash
$ uptime -p
up 10 days, 3 hours, 15 minutes
```

### 3\. Show system startup time

```bash
$ uptime -s
2026-01-11 14:08:45
```

### 4\. Display help

```bash
$ uptime -h
Usage: uptime [OPTION]...
Print the uptime of the system.

  -p, --pretty         show uptime in pretty format
  -s, --since          show system up since
  -V, --version        output version information and exit
  -h, --help           display this help and exit
```

## Notes

- **Load Average:** Load average indicates the average number of processes waiting to run over a period of time. For a single-core CPU, a load average of 1.0 means the system is fully utilized; for a quad-core CPU, 4.0 means full utilization.
    
- `uptime` is similar to `w` and `top` commands but simpler.

```

### 2\. Monitor every 2 seconds

```bash
$ mpstat 2
```

### 3\. Display statistics for a specific CPU (CPU 0)

```bash
$ mpstat -P 0 2 5
```

This will display 5 reports at 2-second intervals for CPU 0.

### 4\. Display all CPUs separately

```bash
$ mpstat -P ALL 2 3
```

### 5\. Display CPU utilization only for user and system time

```bash
$ mpstat -u

# Linux `watch` Command

The `watch` command in Linux is used to execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen. It is commonly used to monitor changes in the output of commands in real-time.

## Syntax

```bash
watch [options] command
```

## Description

`watch` runs a specified command at regular intervals (default 2 seconds) and updates the output in the terminal. This is useful for monitoring system statistics, log files, and real-time changes.

## Common Options

- `-n seconds` : Specify the interval in seconds between command executions.
    
- `-d` : Highlight differences between successive updates.
    
- `-t` : Turn off the header showing interval, command, and current time.
    
- `-g` : Exit when the command output changes.
    
- `-b` : Beep if the command has a non-zero exit.
    

## Examples

### 1\. Basic usage

```bash
$ watch ls -l
```

This will run `ls -l` every 2 seconds and display the output.

### 2\. Change interval to 5 seconds

```bash
$ watch -n 5 df -h
```

This will run `df -h` every 5 seconds to monitor disk usage.

### 3\. Highlight changes

```bash
$ watch -d free -h
```

This will highlight changes in memory usage between successive outputs.

### 4\. Turn off header

```bash
$ watch -t uptime
```

The output of `uptime` will update without showing the header.

### 5\. Exit on change

```bash
$ watch -g cat /tmp/status.txt
```

The command will exit when the content of `/tmp/status.txt` changes.

### 6\. Beep on non-zero exit status

```bash
$ watch -b ping -c1 8.8.8.8
```

This will beep if the ping command fails.

## Notes

- Default interval is 2 seconds if `-n` is not specified.
    
- Useful for monitoring system resources (`top`, `df`, `free`) without continuous manual execution.
    
- Works well in combination with other commands to create real-time dashboards in the terminal.
